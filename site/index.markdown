## Node.js Bindings to the Amazon EC2 Query API

Welcome to `node-ec2`. An ancilliary goal of this project is to come up with an
ideal GitHub CoffeeScript project structure for a Node.js module. Currently, I'm
messing around with Jekyll again and trying to fit the Jekyll pages into the
project, unobtrusively.

This is probably not an exciting page for you at the time of viewing. Please
reference the wiki and the literate documentation.
