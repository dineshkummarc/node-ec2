Deveopment of node-ec2 takes place on the master branch of the node-ec2
repository. We do not check in the generated JavaScript or documentation.

To keep us from doing this we generate a `.gitignore` using the `Cakefile`.

    cake gitignore

We do not check the `.gitignore` file into git, because other branches,
`node_modules` and `gh-pages`, need their own specific `.gitignore` files.

Other cake tasks important to development.

    cake compile
    cake docco
    cake clean
